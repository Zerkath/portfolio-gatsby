# Project Idea

Our groups project idea was to develop a management tool and a reservation system for the public.

Specifically a set of 2 frontends for different users, one for employees and one for the customers.

# Technology stack

Frontends were developed on ReactJS with TypeScript.
Notably we used ant design components for the project.

The Rest API was done with Loopback the api communicated with a PostgreSQL database.

For practice we got to host the services on Kubernetes, specifically AKS.

# TypeScript and WebSocket freetime sandbox

I had some free-time before the holidays in winter and wanted to learn a little about TypeScript and WebSockets.

I also got to try out Lua for the client. I think Lua has a couple of issues in terms of usability and the syntax isn't great.

I had already used SocketIO in a earlier project, but WebSockets were more basic, 
SocketIO allows to send objects directly between clients. WebSockets encode to json.

Currently the project is abandoned due to a busy spring schedule. 
I was going to create a user interface for displaying some controls and I will maybe get around to doing it at some point.
